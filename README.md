A platform to create sites based on vk data model.
--------------------------------------------------

Our goal:
---------

We understand that vk data model is sufficient to keep up a project, and a group is very similar
to a web site already. We'd like to make a projection from a unit of vk data model, such as a user
page, a group or a public, into a static, client-side single page web application with custom
presentation model and styling.


To think of:
------------

How could we integrate a project with vk social graph?
